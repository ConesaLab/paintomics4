"""Read the bundled example catalogue and wire a scenario into a job.

Before this module there was exactly one example, and it was hardcoded in six
places: three servlets each rebuilt filenames by mangling an omic name
("DNase-seq" -> "dnase_values.tab"), and three ExtJS `setExampleMode` functions
each repeated the literal paths. Adding a second example meant editing all six,
so nobody did, and whole features -- MORE, per-condition relevance -- shipped
with no example that reached them.

Now `examplefiles/datasets/manifest.json` is the single source of truth. The
servlets ask this module for a scenario; the client asks it for the list.

Deliberately free of Flask imports so it can be unit-tested directly, and free
of any write path: it only ever reads the bundled tree.

Failure policy
--------------
Example mode disappearing is worse than an example being stale, so every
failure degrades rather than raises:

  * no manifest, unreadable manifest, wrong version -> LEGACY_SCENARIOS, the
    hardcoded bundle this module replaced
  * a scenario whose files are missing -> omitted from listScenarios, so the
    picker cannot offer something that would fail
  * an unknown scenario id -> UserWarning naming the valid ids, which the
    servlets' error handling already renders as a readable message

The one thing it will not do is silently substitute a different scenario for
the one that was asked for.
