    A `..` in the name walks out of the directory, which made those an
    arbitrary file delete and an arbitrary file read respectively. Flask's
    `send_from_directory` refuses that on its own, so the download handler was
    safe on the branch that served an attachment and unsafe on the branch that
    streamed the file itself.

    `realpath` is what does the work: it collapses `..` and *also* resolves
    symlinks, so a link planted inside the directory cannot be used to step
    outside it. Containment is then checked with `commonpath` rather than
    `startswith`, because a plain prefix test accepts a sibling directory whose
    name merely begins the same way (`inputData` vs `inputData_evil`).

    Returns the absolute resolved path when it is genuinely under `baseDir`,
    otherwise None. Existence is not required -- the caller decides that -- but
    the base directory itself is refused, since it is not a file to act on.
