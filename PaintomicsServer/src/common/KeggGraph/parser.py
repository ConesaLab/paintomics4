Every attribute is read by NAME from the element that owns it. The R parser this

(28.2% of mmu subtypes wrong, 194 of 364 pathways affected) and reaction headers
by token position (14.0% of reaction rows corrupted, 2,388 of them holding the
literal attribute name "type"). Both are unrepresentable here by construction.
