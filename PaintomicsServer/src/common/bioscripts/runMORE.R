# longer and parallel is worse, not better: the per-task overhead is unchanged
# while there are fewer workers to spread it across. PySiQ also runs jobs in
# the web server's own process, so those workers would contend with request
# handling for the same 8 vCPUs.

#     myresults$regulator = gsub(prefix, "", myresults$regulator)
#
# to remove the "<omic>-" prefix it uses internally. That gsub is unanchored and
# global, so it deletes the omic name followed by a hyphen ANYWHERE in the ID,
# however many times it occurs. For an omic named "TF" a regulator genuinely
# called "TF-1" comes back as "1"; for an omic named "miRNA", "miRNA-21"
# becomes "21".
#
# It is not cosmetic. The values file is written from the input data and keeps
# the true ID, while the pairs file is written from this table, so the two stop
# agreeing -- and Job.parseGeneBasedFiles looks a values row up in the pairs
# file by GENE:::REGULATOR. Every red star for that omic silently disappears,
# and pathway enrichment moves with it, because enrichment counts significance.
#
# Repair by inverting the mangling against the IDs we actually loaded: apply the
# same substitution to every known regulator and map the result back. Ambiguous
# cases -- two real regulators mangling to the same string, or a mangled value
# that is itself a real ID -- are left untouched and reported, since guessing
# there would be a different silent corruption.

# Strip a leading "<omic>-" from regulator IDs, but never from an ID that is
# itself a real regulator. MORE only prefixes names it had to disambiguate, so
