# CANONICALISE ROW ORDER ------------------------------------------------------
# The writer of <omic>_matched.txt (Job.py) emits its rows in an order that is
# not stable between runs of the same job on the same input: the file's md5
# changes run to run while the md5 of its *sorted* lines does not. Everything
# below used to inherit that order, and two effects turned it into a different
# answer rather than just a different file:
#
#   1. The deduplication on the next line keeps whichever copy of a repeated
#      feature ID happens to come FIRST. Repeated IDs are not rare and they do
#      not carry the same values -- measured on the bundled mmu single-condition
#      example, 193 of the IDs appear more than once and all 193 disagree about
#      the value. "First in the file" is therefore a coin flip that silently
#      rewrote 193 gene values per run.
#   2. Even with identical values, the per-pathway submatrix handed to PCA
#      inherits this order, and the eigen decomposition of a permuted covariance
#      matrix differs in its last bits. The single%-criterion in PCA2GO.2 counts
#      components above a threshold, so those last bits flip how many metagenes
#      a pathway contributes at all: measured 290 to 296 metagenes across 8
#      permutations of one 6-condition input.
#
# The two together made the same job produce a different Step-4 picture every
# run: 12 permutations of one real matched.txt gave 12 different cluster
# memberships and 8 different cluster-size signatures.
#
# Sorting here fixes it for any writer, which is why it belongs in the script
# and not in Job.py. The key is the lowercased feature ID -- the same value the
# deduplication and the row names below key on -- with every remaining column
# appended as a tie-break, so two rows sharing an ID resolve to the
# lexicographically smallest one deterministically instead of by arrival order.
# method = "radix" pins C-locale collation: the default for character vectors is
# the collation locale, which would make the answer depend on the machine's LANG.
# Sorting reorders whole rows, so column identity within a row is untouched, and
# feature_ids below is derived from the sorted frame.

# TODO: we take the first match after the canonical sort above, which is

# open question, and it is a change of statistic rather than of determinism.

# *shape* of the response across conditions, independent of amplitude.
#
# This replaces `dist.res <- Dist(dataScaled, method = "pearson")` fed straight
