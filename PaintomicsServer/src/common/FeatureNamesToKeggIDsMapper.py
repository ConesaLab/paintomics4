    """
    The mapping workers below are forked from a server process that keeps
    serving requests on other threads. A fork can land while one of those
    threads is mid-write, and the child then inherits sys.stdout/sys.stderr
    (and logging file streams) whose buffer locks are held by a thread that
    does not exist in the child: its first print/log call blocks forever.
    CPython re-initialises logging's OWN locks after a fork, but not the
    locks inside buffered IO objects, so the streams themselves must be
    replaced. Observed in production as a worker frozen in
    PyThread_acquire_lock_timed under a progress print until the
    MAX_WAIT_THREADS timeout killed the job -- and terminate() could not
    reap it, because the child also inherits uWSGI's SIGTERM handler, so
    the default disposition is restored here as well.

    Two rules keep this hook from re-creating the very deadlock it exists
    to prevent (both were violated by its first version, and a Manager
    server child sat frozen for 32 minutes on paintomics.uv.es on
    2026-08-17, its parent's ``Manager()`` blocked forever waiting for the
    child's address, one queue worker gone until the service restarted):

      * never FLUSH an inherited stream in the child. That is what
        ``StreamHandler.setStream`` does before swapping, so handlers get
        their ``stream`` attribute assigned directly instead;
      * never DROP the last reference to an inherited stream in the child.
        A TextIOWrapper's finaliser closes it, and closing flushes -- the
        same lock again, this time from inside garbage collection. The old
        objects are parked in ``_inheritedStreams`` for the life of the
        child; whatever they buffered belongs to the parent, which still
        holds them and will write it out itself.

    An in-memory stand-in for the ``kegg_compounds`` collection: the same

    kegg_compounds is a static 93k-document, 1.3 MB collection with only a
    text index, which a case-insensitive substring regex cannot use, so every
    metabolite name used to cost a full collection scan on mongod (20-50 ms
    each -- 40 s for a 4,667-row file even spread over six workers). Here the
    lower-cased names are joined into ONE haystack string and searched with
    str.find, which walks the whole 1.3 MB in well under a millisecond, and
    the hit positions are mapped back to documents in collection order.

    Semantics reproduced from the MongoDB query exactly as
    findCompoundIDByFeatureName issues it: an escaped literal (substring,
    case-insensitive) or the same literal anchored ``^...$`` (whole-name,
    case-insensitive), documents returned in natural (load) order, ``limit``
    honoured on that order. Any other pattern falls back to evaluating the
    compiled regex against every name, which is always correct and merely
    slow. Candidates found by the fast path are re-checked with the compiled
    pattern, so nothing the regex would reject can be returned.
