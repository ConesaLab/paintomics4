"""HTTP surface for the input-conversion agent.

The route is a stateless proxy. It holds the API key, checks the session,
enforces a quota and a concurrency cap, and returns one action. It keeps no
conversation: the browser owns the loop state and sends it back each turn, which
means a worker restart cannot strand a conversion and there is nothing to clean
up when a user closes the tab.

It does NOT wait for the model inline. paintomics4.ini runs processes=1,
threads=4, so four threads serve every request on the site; the CSIC gateway
can take a minute or more per answer. An inline call would hold a quarter of
the site's capacity per conversion and take the site down at four concurrent
users. The work is enqueued and the browser polls, exactly as
aiInterpretInitiate does.

Each turn is bounded (agent_turn.TURN_BUDGET_SECONDS) and a gateway that does
not answer fails the ticket with the reason, which the browser shows. For a
short cooldown after that, new turns are refused at once rather than each
spending the budget to find the same thing out.
