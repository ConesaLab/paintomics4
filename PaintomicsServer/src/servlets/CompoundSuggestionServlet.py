"""The "Choose for me" button behind step 2's compound cards.

Two routes, enqueue-and-poll rather than one blocking call. That is not
politeness: uWSGI serves this whole site with ``processes=1 threads=4``, so a
route that waits on the LLM gateway takes a quarter of the site's capacity with
it, and four concurrent clicks are an outage. The work goes on the same
in-process queue every other long step uses, and the browser polls.

Nothing here writes to the job. The response is advice the user can accept,
adjust or ignore; ``pathwayAcquisitionStep2`` remains the only thing that ever
stores a compound selection.
