    Two engines sit behind one CLI, and which one a job gets is decided here.
    ``engine`` is the user's explicit choice -- ``"rust"``, ``"r"``, or
    ``"auto"``/``None`` for the historical behaviour, under which **PLS1 runs
    on ``more-rs``, the Rust port, whenever a usable binary can be found** and
    everything else runs ``Rscript runMORE.R``.

    An explicit choice is honoured wherever it can be: ``"r"`` always gets R,
    and ``"rust"`` gets the port for PLS1. Where it cannot be honoured the job
    still runs, on R, with a warning -- a stale client asking for an engine
    this host does not have should get the reference answer slowly rather than
    an error, and the interface refuses such a request up front anyway (see
    `engineRefusal`) so this path is the belt to that's braces.

    Why PLS1 can be switched silently and MLR cannot
    ------------------------------------------------
    R's PLS1 path is deterministic -- two independent runs of the bundled
    06-regulatory-more example matched byte for byte -- so the port has a fixed
    target to hit, and hits it: six of seven output files byte-identical, the
    seventh (the rpc table) the same rows in a different order, because MORE
    sorts them by omic name under R's locale collation and reproducing that
    would encode a locale dependency. Swapping the engine is therefore
    invisible to whoever reads the results, which is what makes a silent
    default legitimate.

    R's MLR path is **not** deterministic. It draws from the RNG in three
    places, the visible one being ``sample(correlacionados, 1)``, which picks
    which member of a collapsed clique of correlated regulators survives as the
    group representative. The port implements MLR in full -- elastic net,
    collinearity grouping and all -- but it cannot be byte-equal to something
    that is not equal to itself: R's own answer moves between seeds, and the
    port was measured to sit *inside that seed band* rather than on any one
    point in it. Group membership is deterministic and the expansion reports
    every member, so the edge set is stable either way; what moves is which
    member a collapsed group's coefficients are attributed to. That is a
    difference worth opting into and a bad one to impose, so MLR keeps the
    engine whose numbers its users have already seen. Any method this function
    does not recognise goes to R for the blunter reason that R owns the full
    method surface.

    R also wins whenever the port cannot actually be run:

    * ``PAINTOMICS_MORE_RS`` set to ``off`` (see MORE_RS_OFF), the opt-out.
    * A configured path that is not on disk -- a stale setting must degrade to
      R, not take MORE down.
    * A configured path without the executable bit, which an unpacked archive
      loses easily and which would otherwise surface as EACCES from Popen.

    ``binaryPath`` defaults to the ``MORE_RS_BINARY`` setting and is a
    parameter so the choice can be exercised without mutating the environment.
