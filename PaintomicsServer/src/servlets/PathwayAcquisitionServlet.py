# response boundary, and never in toBSON.

    plain safe mode silently drops the pathway background and exports a black
    PNG. This keeps the embedded case working and refuses the rest.

    A blank image is returned rather than an exception because that is what
    CairoSVG's stub does, so an SVG naming something external still renders
    (without it) instead of failing the whole export. ``read_url`` normalises
    a bare path to ``file://<abspath>`` before calling this, so a plain
    ``/etc/passwd`` href arrives here with a scheme and is refused like any
    other.

            bytestring, forbid_entities=not unsafe,
            forbid_external=not unsafe)
        ...
        if 'url_fetcher' not in kwargs and not unsafe:
            self.url_fetcher = (
                lambda *args, **kwargs: b'<svg width="1" height="1"></svg>')

    so it accepted entity definitions (billion laughs) and installed the real
    URL fetcher in place of that stub. ``read_url`` normalises a bare path to
    ``file://<abspath>``, so with the real fetcher in place
    ``<image xlink:href="/etc/passwd">`` reads a local file and an ``http://``
    href is a request from inside the deployment network. The markup comes
    from ``request.form.get("svgCode")``, so that was reachable by any user
    holding a session cookie, and the render is written into the job output
    directory and served back over /get_cluster_image/.

    Turning the flag off is not sufficient on its own, and this is the part
    worth remembering: CairoSVG's stub fetcher intercepts ``data:`` URIs too,
    and the legitimate export is *entirely* data: URIs. PathwayController.js
    draws the pathway background into a canvas, takes
    ``forcedImageCode = canvas.toDataURL()`` and substitutes that for the PNG's
    URL before posting. So `unsafe=False` alone renders the pathway background
    as a black rectangle -- measured, not assumed. Hence the explicit fetcher.

    ``PNGSurface.convert`` rather than ``svg2png``: the latter has a fixed
    keyword list and drops ``url_fetcher``, while ``convert`` forwards **kwargs
    to the parser. It is what ``svg2png`` calls anyway.

    Pinned by src/tests/test_svg_export_is_sandboxed.py, which checks both
    halves -- that a local file's pixels stay out of the render, and that an
    embedded data: URI still reaches it.
