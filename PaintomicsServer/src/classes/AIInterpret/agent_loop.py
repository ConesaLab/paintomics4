"""The full-agent workflow: one Lead Interpreter Agent running a tool loop.

Design document: ``docs/diagrams/paintomics-ai-agent-proposal.drawio`` (and the
exported ``.drawio.png``). This module is that page, translated:

  * **The loop** -- one SDK ``Agent`` ("Lead Interpreter") whose Observe ->
    Decide -> Act cycle is the Agents SDK tool loop: every turn the model sees
    the notebook and tool results so far (Observe), emits one tool call
    (Decide/Act), and continues until it calls ``submit_report`` -- the only
    door out of the loop.
  * **The toolbelt** -- the existing modules wrapped as tools. The agent
    chooses WHAT; the tool enforces HOW MUCH: the search spend meter, the
    PubMed rate limit and the retrieval guard all live inside
    ``search_literature``, never in the prompt.
  * **Sub-agents** -- reachable only through the ``delegate_*`` tools, and the
    fan-out inside them is parallel bounded calls, not unbounded sub-loops.
  * **The mandatory exit gate** -- outside the loop, where no decision can
    skip it: the same quote collection, canonical references rebuild,
    per-citation Claim Verifier pass and Phase-6 programmatic net
    (verify -> redact -> renumber -> sort) the workflow arm runs.
  * **Loop backstops** -- max turns, a tool-output character ledger, the
    wall-clock deadline and the cancel flag. Hitting one ends the run loudly
    (``stats`` records which), never silently.

Why the loop is budgeted the way it is -- measured on the CSIC gateway
(2026-08-17, see agent.py's transport notes): short single-shot calls
parallelise (32 concurrent in 5.6 s) while tool loops and long generations
serialise, so the design keeps Decide turns terse, makes every fan-out
single-shot, and allows exactly one long-form generation (the report) inside
the loop. The default budget is 10 minutes end to end: the loop gets what is
left after ``AI_AGENT_GATE_RESERVE`` seconds are set aside for the exit gate.

Off by default. ``AI_FULL_AGENT=1`` routes ``run_ai_agent`` here; everything
else (servlet, queue, DAO contract, progress statuses) is unchanged, so the
two arms stay comparable run for run.

written and archived by nothing, so there is no history to settle it with; they
are archived from round 38. If the batches genuinely do not cite, then chunk

    # every delegated report, with the full master reference list attached. It
    # fixed length (8 870 -> 38 480 chars) and coverage (9 -> 18.5 pathways) and
    # wrecked grounding -- citations fell to 4.5, and round 6 showed why: a writer
    # handed ninety references cites three of them. agent.py records the same
    # effect for its batches ("a batch handed 20+ abstracts cites fewer of them").
    #
    # The delegated reports are ALREADY grounded: each was written against the <=10
    # papers attributed to its own pathways. So do not re-author them. Stitch them
    # in as the per-pathway analysis and spend the single writer call only on the
    # framing prose, where reference dilution costs nothing. That is the workflow
    # arm's grounding property -- per-batch attributed slices, preserved through
    # synthesis -- without its fixed control flow: the agent still chose what to
    # investigate, what to delegate and what to submit.
