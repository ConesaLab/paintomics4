"""The AI interpretation agent workflow, built on the OpenAI Agents SDK.

This is the production entry point for AI interpretation: the SDK's ``Runner``
drives the agent loop and tool round-trips, and structured phases declare a
pydantic ``output_type`` instead of parsing free text. Everything that is not
orchestration lives in sibling modules and is shared by import:

  * prompts (``prompts.py``), tool bodies (``tools.py``)
  * literature retrieval (``pubmed_client.py``)
  * context builders (``context_builder.py``)
  * cross-pipeline helpers (``shared.py``)
  * budgets from ``serverconf.py``

The SDK is async-first while PaintOmics runs on PySiQ's threads, so the public
entry points stay synchronous and own their own event loop:

  * ``run_ai_agent(job_id, experiment_design, RESPONSE)`` -- servlet-facing
    adapter (DAO progress, persistence, cancellation, concurrency semaphore).
  * ``run_agent_loop_workflow`` (in ``agent_loop.py``) -- the bare interpreter,
    and the only arm. The fixed six-phase workflow that lived here was removed.
