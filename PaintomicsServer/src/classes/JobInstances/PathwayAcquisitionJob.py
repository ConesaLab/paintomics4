        the Step 3 hub-analysis Paint column.

        Derived, not stored. The field is in PAINTOMICS4_LARGE_FIELDS (2.67 MB
        on the six-omic example), so it is never written to MongoDB and the
        attribute is None on any process that did not run step 2 itself -- i.e.
        on every job opened from its URL after a restart. Returning the
        attribute there made both panels dead, silently.

        Nothing needs storing: the neighbourhoods are a pure function of the
        organism's KEGG graph (static, cached per process by
        src.common.KeggGraph.store) intersected with `inputCompoundsData`, and
        inputCompoundsData is persisted. This is the same arrangement
        getGlobalExpressionData() has always had, which is why that field -- in
        the same LARGE_FIELDS set -- survives a reopen and this one did not.

        A job with no compounds returns {} without deriving anything, and
        gene-only jobs are the common case.

        The dict check is the whole point of the guard, not defensiveness:
        DAO.adaptBSON turns every None leaf into the STRING "None" -- documented
        there, depended on across the database -- so a reopened job arrives with
        `compoundRegulateFeatures == "None"`, which is truthy. Testing
        truthiness alone returned that string, the servlet's _as_dict() turned
        it into {}, and the recovery path was exactly as dead as before.
        Measured: `repr(job.compoundRegulateFeatures)` after loadJobInstance is
        `'None'`, four characters.
