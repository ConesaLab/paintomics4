# Local secrets: PaintomicsServer/.env
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every secret below is read with os.getenv, so it lives in the ENVIRONMENT and
# not in this file. That is right for deployment and hostile to local work: a
# key exported in one shell is gone in the next terminal, gone under the IDE,
# gone in a test runner -- and this file is gitignored, so a key pasted into it
# survives locally but vanishes on any fresh checkout or reinstall. The usual
# symptom is "I set the key and AI interpretation still reports no token".
#
# So a `.env` beside the server is loaded here, before anything calls getenv:
#
#     PaintomicsServer/.env
#     AI_CSIC_API_KEY=sk-...
#
# `.env` is already gitignored (.gitignore:81), so it cannot be pushed.
#
# Two properties worth keeping:
#   * a REAL environment variable always wins. Production sets these through
#     systemd or the container, and a stray .env on the box must never override
#     what the deployment configured -- hence setdefault, never assignment.
#   * failure is silent. A missing or malformed .env leaves the server exactly
#     as it was, because a config module that raises on import takes the whole
#     servlet down and the traceback surfaces far from its cause.

# ========== MORE BACKEND ==========
# Absolute path to `more-rs`, the Rust port of MORE. It takes the same
# arguments as runMORE.R and was measured against it on the bundled
# 06-regulatory-more example: six of the seven output files byte-identical, the
# seventh (the rpc table) holding the same rows in a different order.
#
# **PLS1 runs on the port by default.** Blank -- the default -- does NOT mean
# "use R": it means "go and find a binary", which MOREServlet._discoverMoreRs
# does by looking beside runMORE.R at src/common/bioscripts/more-rs and then on
# PATH. A host with no binary finds nothing and runs R, exactly as before, so
# the default is safe on a machine that has never heard of the port.
#
# Set this to a path to name one explicitly, or to `off` to force R for every
# job. MLR always runs on R whatever this says -- R's MLR path draws from the
# RNG in three places, so the port can only sit inside R's own seed band rather
# than reproduce it, and that is a difference to opt into rather than impose.
# See MOREServlet._resolveMOREBackend for the full reasoning.
MORE_RS_BINARY = os.getenv("PAINTOMICS_MORE_RS", "")

# Seconds a single MORE analysis may be *predicted* to take before the server
# refuses it at submit time, instead of accepting it and killing it when the
# queue timeout expires.
#
# This is not a new limit -- MOREServlet already enqueues every MORE job with a
# 1800 s timeout. What is new is finding out before the wait rather than after
# it. Measured on the STATegra TF->gene set (9,835 genes, 36 samples, ~30
# regulators/gene), one process at a time:
#
#     R MLR      ~3.4 h        R PLS1     ~1.7 h        more-rs PLS1  ~9 s
#
# so on an R-only host this is reached by ordinary genome-scale data, and the
# guard covers PLS1 as well as MLR. A host running the port is effectively
# never gated, because the estimate is keyed on the engine that will actually
# run (see MORECostModel).
#
# Raise it only in step with the queue timeout -- a budget above that just
# moves the failure back to where it was. Set it to 0 to disable the check.
