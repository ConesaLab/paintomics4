"""A feature that matches no pathway is normal, and must not be logged as an error.

Why this exists
---------------
`calculateTotalFeaturesByOmic` ended its per-feature loop with

    if not found_in_any_db:
        logging.error("STEP2 - Feature not present in at least one pathway " + feature.getID())

A feature in no pathway of any database is not an error. Most measured genes are
not annotated to a pathway at all, so this fires for the ordinary case. Measured
on one run of the six-omic example: **6480 ERROR lines**, out of 17526 input
features. Every one of them described a healthy feature.

The cost is that the log stops working as a diagnostic. `grep ERROR` on
application.log is the first thing anyone does when a job fails, and it returned
thousands of lines about genes that were fine, with any real error buried among
them. It also writes 6480 lines per run to a file that is already six figures
long, on a VM with a fixed disk.

So the per-feature line moved to debug -- the level that matches "detail you
want only when chasing a specific mapping problem" -- and the loop now reports
once:

    STEP2 - 6480 of 17526 features matched no pathway in any database
            (e.g. 21385, 231841, 72614, 277463, 66368)

which is the more useful message anyway: a proportion tells an operator whether
the identifier type is wrong (nearly all unmapped) or whether this is the normal
tail (a third of them, as here). A per-feature list never said that.

Verified end to end, same example, before and after: ERROR lines 6480 -> 0.

Worth stating plainly: the shipped `logging.cfg` sets the root logger to DEBUG
and `launch_server.py` copies that same file into a deployment, so the
per-feature lines are still written to disk. This change fixes the severity, not
the volume. Raising the deployed log level is a separate decision and not one to
make silently inside a debugging pass.

Usage:
    cd PaintomicsServer
    python -m src.tests.test_unmapped_features_are_not_errors
