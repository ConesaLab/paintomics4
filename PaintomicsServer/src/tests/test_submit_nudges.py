"""submit_report may ask once. Never twice, never a veto.

Two things the agent reliably already knows are wrong at submit time:

  * it never delegated, so the report cannot cover the experiment;
  * its own check_my_citations run found citations with no supporting quote,
    and they are still in the draft.

Both are worth one question. Neither is worth a refusal: a tool that can refuse
twice is a workflow step wearing a tool's clothes, and the whole point of this
arm is that the agent decides.

The citation nudge is measured, not guessed. Over the 28 archived runs that
called check_my_citations, the 10 that re-checked after a bad result improved
every time -- 11/6 -> 7/0, 14/7 -> 8/0, 10/4 -> 10/0 -- and none got worse. The
18 that checked once sometimes submitted with flagged citations still in place,
and those become redactions that delete their sentences.
