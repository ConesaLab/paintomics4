"""A pathway image export must survive Werkzeug's form-memory limit.

WHAT BROKE
----------
`d6bcf643` ("Upgrade the Flask stack") pinned `Werkzeug==3.1.8`. Werkzeug 3.1
changed `max_form_memory_size` in two ways at once:

  * its default went from unlimited to 500_000 bytes, and
  * it is now applied to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies, where
    before it only bounded non-file fields of a *multipart* body.

    # werkzeug/formparser.py -- FormDataParser._parse_urlencoded
    if (self.max_form_memory_size is not None
            and content_length is not None
            and content_length > self.max_form_memory_size):
        raise RequestEntityTooLarge()

`paintomicsserver.py` set only `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` (100 MB), so the 100 MB
never got a say: the urlencoded branch compares Content-Length against
`max_form_memory_size` alone.

`PathwayController.js` posts the whole pathway SVG as one urlencoded form
field, with the pathway background inlined as a base64 `data:` URI, so the
bodies are large by construction. Measured in Chrome against a live job
(mmu01100, STATegra):

    background raster   4961 x 3199 px
    data: URI           3,650,422 chars
    serialised SVG      4,130,099 chars
    urlencoded body     4,408,629 bytes      <- 8.8x over the 500 kB default

Every such export came back as

    RequestEntityTooLarge: AT PathwayAcquisitionServlet.py:
    pathwayAcquisitionSaveImage. ERROR MESSAGE: 413 Request Entity Too Large

raised by the *first* `request.form` access in the handler
(`request.form.get("jobID")`) and reformatted by `handleException`, which is
why it reached users as an in-app message rather than a browser-level failure.
22 of the 1172 KEGG pathway images bust 500 kB on the background alone, so it
failed per-pathway -- big overview maps only -- and looked intermittent.

WHAT THESE TESTS ASSERT
-----------------------
`testTheDefaultRejectsAnExportSizedBody` is the control. It is the same
request against an app that sets only MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH, and it fails with 413
-- without it the positive test would pass on any Werkzeug whose default is
generous, and stop meaning anything.

File uploads are deliberately not covered: the multipart parser sets
`field_size = None` for `File` parts and skips the check entirely, so Step 1
was never affected by this and does not need pinning here.

Usage:
    cd PaintomicsServer
    python -m src.tests.test_form_memory_limit
