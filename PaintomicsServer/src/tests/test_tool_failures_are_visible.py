"""A tool that raises must not look like a tool nobody called.

The SDK catches any exception a tool raises, hands the model "An error occurred
while running the tool", and carries on. `_trace` runs at the END of each tool,
so a raise also means no trace event -- and in the archive a tool failing on
every call is indistinguishable from a tool the agent chose not to use. Every
adoption and cost figure measured over the 60 archived runs counts successful
calls only.

This was not theoretical: the first version of the delegation-cache tests passed
against a fixture that raised KeyError on every call, because the swallowed
error came back as an ordinary string.

Each tool now carries a failure_error_function that records the failure in the
run journal and tells the model what broke.
