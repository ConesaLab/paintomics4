"""A DAO connection must be closed even when the operation using it raises.

Why this exists
---------------
It began as a thread leak. `DBmanager.openConnection` used to build a **new
`MongoClient` per DAO**, each with its own PyMongo topology-monitor threads:
measured on this machine, ten managers left unclosed took the process from 1
thread to 26, and closing them returned it to 1. A leaked DAO was ~2.5 leaked
threads plus its sockets.

**That cost is gone.** `DBmanager` now hands out one process-wide client keyed
on `(host, port, pid)`, `closeConnection` is a reference drop, and
`getCollection` looks the client up on every call -- so an unclosed manager
costs nothing at all. `SharedClientCostTest` below measures exactly that, and
it is what the old `LeakCostTest` was replaced with: a test that asserted
leaking still costs threads would now be asserting the bug this change removed.

The finally rule above survives the reason it was written for. What it enforces
now is that a DAO does not outlive the request that made it: a manager kept
past its handler is the one way a stale client reference can still be carried
across a `fork()` (the mapper and enrichment workers are forked children), and
"close it in a finally" is the shape the codebase settled on for that.

Several handlers closed theirs on the success path only:

    daoInstance = MessageDAO()
    matchedMessages = daoInstance.findAll(...)   # <- raises
    daoInstance.closeConnection()                # <- skipped

The `except` below catches the error and the request returns a tidy failure, so
nothing looks wrong from outside. What makes this worth fixing is *when* it
fires: `findAll` raises when MongoDB is unreachable or slow, which is exactly
when every request starts failing at once. Each one then leaks a client whose
monitor threads keep retrying the database that is already struggling, so the
failure mode compounds instead of settling.

`adminServletGetMessage` is the sharpest case -- it backs the public welcome
banner (`message_type == "starting_message"` skips the session check), so it is
hit on every page load by every visitor.
