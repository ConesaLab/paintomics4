"""Every vendored asset the client asks for must exist on disk.

The vendored third-party libraries under `PaintomicsClient/public_html` shipped
with their upstream *build toolchains* attached -- Bootstrap 3.3.7 brought its
Grunt config, its Jekyll docs Gemfile and a `package-lock.json`; Tooltipster
brought a `package-lock.json` and 4494 files of committed `node_modules`. None
of it is installed, executed or served: the app loads four files in total,
all from `dist/`.

Dependabot cannot tell the difference. Those manifests accounted for 68 of the
repository's open alerts -- more than half -- across packages like grunt,
handlebars, lodash and jekyll that no deployed code path can reach. Removing
the manifests removes the alerts, and removing the committed `node_modules`
stops several megabytes of unreviewed third-party JavaScript being publicly
downloadable, since everything under `public_html` is served.

The risk in that deletion is deleting one file too many, and `dist/` looks
incidental next to `less/` and `grunt/`. This test is the guard: it parses the
client's own markup and stylesheets for references into the vendored
directories and asserts each one resolves. It is deliberately derived from the
references rather than from a hand-written list, so a newly added `<script>`
tag is covered without anyone remembering to update it.

Not covered on purpose: whether the assets *work*, only that they are present.
A broken minified bundle is a different failure and a different test.

Usage:
    cd PaintomicsServer
    python -m src.tests.test_vendored_assets_are_present
