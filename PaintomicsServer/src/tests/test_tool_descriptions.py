"""Tool descriptions are prompt text, and prompt text goes stale.

Every description in TOOLBELT rides in EVERY Decide turn of every run, so it is
both the most-read documentation in the system and a standing token cost. Two
failure modes have already happened here:

  * a claim that stopped being true. read_paper said "an unread citation is the
    kind the verifier removes". Measured over 28 runs, citations to papers the
    agent had read passed verification at 73% against 84% for ones it had not --
    so the description was telling the agent the opposite of the evidence.

  * a claim that discouraged what works. check_my_citations said it was "worth
    running once", while the runs that ran it twice improved every time.

These tests do not check that a description is true -- nothing can. They check
that it does not promise an outcome the pipeline cannot deliver, and that it
stays short enough to be worth its place in every turn.
