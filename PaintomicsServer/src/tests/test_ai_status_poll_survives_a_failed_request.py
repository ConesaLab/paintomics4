"""The AI status poll must survive a request that does not land.

``pollAIStatus`` (PA_Step3Views.js) is a self-rescheduling chain: each answer
schedules the next poll. It rescheduled only from its ``success`` handler and
declared no ``error`` handler at all, so the chain was one dropped request from
being over -- permanently, and silently.

Measured in Chrome against a real job (2026-08-17): five healthy polls, the
server restarted, the sixth answered ``ERR http=0``, and the page never issued
another status request. The interpretation finished and was stored; the widget
sat at "Generating interpretation..." with an empty message area until the user
reloaded the page. That is the whole of the reported bug -- the finished report
only appearing after a refresh -- and an AI run is 5 to 15 minutes of polling
every 3 seconds, so one blip (a deploy, a sleep/wake, a VPN reconnect) is
enough.

A non-answer is not a verdict about the job. Only ``done``, ``error`` and
``cancelled`` end the chain; everything else must try again.

Usage:
    cd PaintomicsServer
    python -m src.tests.test_ai_status_poll_survives_a_failed_request
