"""One job may have only one step in the queue at a time.

Why this exists
---------------
This is the invariant that makes sharing a job instance safe, so it deserves a
test of its own rather than being left as a comment.

`loadJobInstance` was changed (68faf35b's sibling, in JobInformationManager) to
hand every concurrent caller the *same* `PathwayAcquisitionJob` object instead
of loading a private copy each. That closed a lost update: two requests holding
separate copies each stored theirs, and the later write erased the earlier one.

But sharing raises the opposite question, and it is the one worth checking:
if two requests now hold one mutable object, can two of them mutate it at once?
Step 2 is not a read -- it does

    jobInstance.updateSubmitedCompoundsList(selectedCompounds)
    jobInstance.generateMetagenesList(ROOT_DIRECTORY, clusterNumber)
    jobInstance.setLastStep(3)
    JobInformationManager().storeJobInstance(jobInstance, 2)

so two concurrent step 2s on one job would interleave those writes on a single
instance. Before the change they would have corrupted two separate objects,
which is bad differently, not less.

They cannot, and the reason is `Queue.enqueue`. Step 1 and step 2 both enqueue
under `job_id=jobID` -- the job's own id, not a per-step one -- so the second
submission for a job that is still queued or running is refused:

    RuntimeError: Job already at the queue (Job id : ...)

Checked against the running server: two simultaneous POSTs to /pa_step2 for one
job returned HTTP 200 and HTTP 400, the 400 carrying exactly that message.

And the guard is atomic, which is the part that actually matters. `enqueue`
takes `self.lock` before testing `job_id in self.jobs` and does not release it
until after `self.jobs[job_id] = job`, so the test and the insert cannot be
split. That is what distinguishes it from the five check-then-act bugs fixed
this session, every one of which tested shared state under a lock, released it,
and acted on a conclusion that had already expired.

So this file does not fix anything. It pins the property the fix depends on: if
someone later narrows that lock to just the dictionary write -- an entirely
reasonable-looking change, since the dictionary is what needs protecting -- the
duplicate guard silently stops working and concurrent step 2s start interleaving
on one shared instance. Nothing else in the suite would notice.
