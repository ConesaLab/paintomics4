"""read_paper must not fetch a paper to return text it is already holding.

search_literature fetches every abstract into paper_index. Measured across the
archive, 342 of 378 read_paper calls (90%) then asked for exactly that
abstract -- and each one triggered a full-text upgrade first, ~2.6 s of NCBI
time, before returning the cached text. read_paper is 10.5% of the gateway
bill; nine calls in ten were paying for something they did not need.
