"""The agent was shown 9.5% of the genes and none of the ones that mattered.

Measured on the frozen STATegra job (102 significant pathways, the same job the
sealed AgentEvolve rubric was written against):

    matched genes in the universe          10583
    genes the agent was ever shown          1010   (9.5%)
    widest pathway: Pathways in cancer   460 -> 10

The cut is `_get_top_genes(..., limit=10)`, ordered by relevance then effect
size, so what survives is the loudest ten. The rubric names eleven genes:

    Srm Sms Amd1 Odc1 Dok1 Dok2 Dok3 Myc Igll1 Ikzf1   in the job, INVISIBLE
    Ret                                                 visible

Ten of eleven, including Ikzf1 -- the transcription factor the experiment is
ABOUT. Scoring nine production STATegra reports against that rubric, four items
were never earned in any of them, and three of the four (D3 DOK down, E3
polyamine genes down, E4 Myc) are exactly the genes above. They were not missed;
they were unreachable, and no prompt can fix a gene that is not in the context.

So: two tools, both instant and both free -- name a gene and get its values from
anywhere in the upload, and list every gene in a pathway rather than ten.
