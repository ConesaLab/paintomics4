"""The data-management tools must normalise an upload's encoding before reading.

Why this exists
---------------
`cab1dd57` gave Bed2GeneJob and MiRNA2GeneJob the `ensure_utf8` call that
PathwayAcquisitionJob already had, because both read their uploads with a bare

    open(relevantFileName, 'r')

which decodes using the locale. A spreadsheet exported as cp1252/latin-1 --
what Excel writes by default outside a UTF-8 locale -- therefore raised

    UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xd1 in position 4

out of a validation routine, reaching the user as an internal error rather than
a message about their file. One accented gene name is enough.

That fix shipped with no test. It was verified by hand at the time and then had
nothing holding it in place: replacing the guard with `encodingError = None`
left all 87 tests passing. This file closes that hole, and it exists because a
mutation run over this session's fixes caught six of seven and missed exactly
this one.

What is pinned is the behaviour rather than the call: a latin-1 file must be
readable after validateFile has seen it, and a UTF-8 or ASCII file must come
back byte-identical, since rewriting files that were already fine would be its
own bug.

Usage:
    cd PaintomicsServer
    python -m src.tests.test_dm_upload_encoding
