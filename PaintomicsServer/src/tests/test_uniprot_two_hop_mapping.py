"""An identifier reachable only two hops away in the xref graph must still map.

Why this exists
---------------
`mates` is built by *shared transcript* (AdminTools/scripts/common_build_database.py
line ~3203: the mate set of an xref is the union of the xref sets of every
transcript it appears on). Ensembl transcripts and RefSeq transcripts are
near-disjoint, so a species' xref graph splits into an Ensembl-anchored side and
a RefSeq/UniProt-anchored side, joined only through the gene-level identifiers
that appear on both.

`findIDsByFeaturesName` walked exactly one hop. So for input keyed on Ensembl
gene ids -- which is what every bundled example dataset uses -- a database keyed
on `uniprot_acc` was unreachable for roughly half the genes, although the
accession is demonstrably present in the database one hop further on. Measured
on the local mmu install, 2026-08-19:

    OmniPath (uniprot_acc)   ds01  54.9%  ->  87.7% reachable
                             STATegra 43.5%  ->  84.8% reachable
    Reactome was hit the same way (57.0% / 45.0%).

Concretely, ENSMUSG00000000037 (Scml2): its own mate group carries entrezgene
107815 and no UniProt at all; the mate group of entrez 107815 carries
B1AVB4/I6L9E4/Q8BYC8.

The fix bridges one further hop, and only for the names the first hop missed.
The bridge is restricted to GENE_LEVEL_BRIDGE_DATABASES -- identifiers that name
a gene and only ever name one gene -- so the extra hop is an identity step, not
a similarity step. Bridging through a transcript or peptide identifier would be
unsound: a shared peptide can join two paralogues, which would map a feature
onto its family member and report it as a match.

That soundness claim was measured, not assumed, on 3,000 mmu features:
  * 0 cases where the two-hop answer contradicted the one-hop answer;
  * 1,558 recovered (name, accession) pairs, of which 1,558 carried a gene
    symbol equal to the input feature's own symbol, and 0 disagreed.

These tests use a hand-built fake xref collection rather than a live MongoDB, so
they run anywhere and pin the *behaviour* (which hops are taken, what is
bridged, what is refused) rather than one species' data.
