"""miRNA2Genes must not write an association row with no target gene ID.

The behaviour this guards
-------------------------
A user's own regulator_associations file -- produced by this method and handed
back to them as a successful result -- was measured at

    6,039 rows, 6,039 of them with an EMPTY target gene identifier (100%)

An identifier is what makes a row mean anything. Written without one, a row is
not a weak result; it is not a result. The job reported success anyway.

Where it goes: three steps later MORE refuses the analysis with

    Association file for omic 'miRNA' shares no target IDs with the target
    expression file.
      association targets:
      expression features: Fxyd4, Klk15, Gm49311

-- nothing after "association targets:", because there was nothing to print.
The user is sent to check that both files "identify features the same way",
which is unanswerable: one side has no identifiers at all.

`geneID` comes from `line[1].upper()` at MiRNA2GeneJob.py:413 with nothing
asserting it is non-empty, and none of the five writes in the output loop
looked at it.

Rows without an identifier are now skipped and counted, the count is logged,
and a run where EVERY row was unnamed raises instead of shipping a file of
empty strings -- matching this file's existing habit of raising when the
association process returns nothing at all (MiRNA2GeneJob.py:496).

Usage:
    cd PaintomicsServer
    python -m src.tests.test_no_association_without_an_identifier
