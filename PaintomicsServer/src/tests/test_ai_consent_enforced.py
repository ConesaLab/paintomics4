"""Nothing leaves for the AI service unless the job's owner asked for it.

Why this exists
---------------
The upload page asks for consent in as many words -- "Enable AI pathway
interpretation (sends analysis summaries to external AI service)" -- and the
answer is stored on the job:

    jobInstance.setAIConsent(formFields.get("aiConsent", "false"))

It was then read in four places, all of them putting it into a response, and
checked in none. `aiInterpretInitiate` verified the session, the feature flag,
that a jobID was supplied and that the job existed, and started the pipeline.

Measured against a job whose stored record says aiConsent False -- a user who
had cleared the box -- posting its id to the endpoint returned success, and the
run went through triage, search planning, 8.1 seconds of literature retrieval,
interpretation and synthesis, reaching

    https://llm.iiia.es/v1/chat/completions

It stopped there only because this machine has no API key. A deployment with one
would have sent the analysis summary. The PubMed queries need no key and had
already gone out, so the 401 was not a saving grace.

Job ids are not secret -- the results page prints a shareable URL -- so the
decision has to be enforced on the server rather than by the client choosing not
to ask.

Checked statically. Standing the handler up needs a Flask request, a queue and
MongoDB; what matters is that the consent is consulted before the pipeline is
reached, and that reads off the source. Comments are stripped so a commented-out
check does not count. The behaviour itself was verified against the running
server: the declined job is now refused with a message naming the setting, while
a job that did consent still starts.

Usage:
    cd PaintomicsServer
    python -m src.tests.test_ai_consent_enforced
