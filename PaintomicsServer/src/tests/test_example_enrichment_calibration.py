"""Does the simulated example data behave like data, or like a fixture?

`test_example_scenarios_validate.py` asks whether the files are well formed.
This asks whether the *statistics* they produce are believable, which is a
different failure and one that nothing else here would catch: a scenario can be
perfectly well formed, load without error, and still call two thirds of KEGG
significant -- at which point the enrichment view is a wall of red and the
example teaches the opposite of what enrichment is for.

The yardstick is the real STATegra data shipped alongside, measured through the
same pipeline:

    omic              global relevant   mean per-pathway   ratio   significant
    Gene expression        82.4%              49.9%         0.61     54/846  6.4%
    Proteomics             13.3%               9.2%         0.69      5/657  0.8%
    miRNA-seq              22.1%               5.7%         0.26     24/816  2.9%
    DNase-seq              49.6%              52.5%         1.06     98/869   11%
    TF                     83.2%              21.4%         0.26     36/740  4.9%
    Metabolomics           70.7%              44.5%         0.63      0/366    0%

So: 0.8% to 11% of pathways significant, and a mean per-pathway relevant rate
between a quarter of the global rate and a little above it. The simulated
scenarios used to sit at 41-68% significant with a ratio of 3.2-4.7, for one
reason -- the planted signal did not stay in the pathways it was planted in.
KEGG pathways share genes freely (a mouse gene is in 3.85 of them on average),
so planting 70% of a hub pathway marks a slice of a hundred others, and the
hypergeometric background becomes the planted signal itself.

Measured, before and after the generator was changed to plant only in
*peripheral* pathways and to scatter a diffuse 5% of relevance over the
background (`python -m src.AdminTools.scripts.exampledata`):

    scenario                          before            after
    gene-single-condition          207/364  56.9%    26/364   7.1%
    gene-multi-condition           196/364  53.8%    24/364   6.6%
    gene-multi-condition-relevance 233/364  64.0%    17/364   4.7%
    multiomics-integration         228/364  62.6%    39/364  10.7%
    regulatory-mirna               179/359  49.9%    14/356   3.9%
    region-based (through B2G)     212/351  60.4%    27/360   7.5%

The hypergeometric recomputation here is offline -- pathway membership from the
KEGG snapshot, relevance from the shipped files -- rather than a pipeline run,
because a run of all six takes minutes and this takes seconds. It was checked
against the real thing: for gene-single-condition it reports 26 significant
pathways and PathwayAcquisitionJob.generatePathwaysList reports 26, and before
the change both reported 207.

    Both halves have been missing, one at a time.

    `_pickTargets` used to hand back the planted signal, find it smaller than
    MORE_TARGETS, and silently widen the pool to the entire mouse gene
    universe -- so the 250 modelled genes were a random draw from 10406 and the
    four declared pathways held 0, 0, 1 and 2 of them. The run reported 0 of
    289 matched pathways significant while the ground-truth file claimed four.

    The correction confined every modelled gene to the declared targets, and
    the test that pinned it asserted exactly that. It made the coverage claim
    true and the fixture useless: with no gene outside the targets there is no
    population to draw a hypergeometric sample from, 90.4% of modelled genes
    came back relevant, and a full run reported 1 significant pathway of 96 --
    mmu01100, not a declared target -- with the declared ones at p 0.109 to
    0.976. A pathway fixture needs both halves, so this asserts both.
