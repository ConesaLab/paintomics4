"""A tool that drops what it was asked for must say which, and in whose order.

Two caps in this arm truncated silently, and both did it in RANK order over the
whole universe rather than in the order the Lead asked:

  * get_pathway_details broke out of the loop at 8 blocks. Name twenty pathways
    and you got the eight best-ranked of them, with nothing in the answer about
    the other twelve. The agent could not ask again for what it did not know it
    was missing, and could not tell "the tool stopped" from "those pathways have
    no data".
  * delegate_interpretation sliced the resolved list at DELEGATE_MAX_PATHWAYS,
    same silence, same re-sorting of the request into p-value order first.

Neither cap had ever bound in production -- coverage was 15-18 against a cap of
60 -- which is exactly why they survived: an invisible limit that rarely fires
is indistinguishable from no limit until the day the agent finally asks for
more. The point of this arm is that the AGENT decides scope, and it cannot do
that against a tool that edits the request without a word.
