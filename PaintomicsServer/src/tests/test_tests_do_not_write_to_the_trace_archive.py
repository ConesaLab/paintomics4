"""A test must not put fabricated tool calls into the measurement corpus.

`_trace` archives every tool call to CLIENT_TMP_DIR/ai_traces. That directory is
not scratch: it is the corpus every tool-usefulness figure in this project comes
from, and it now holds servlet runs as well as benchmark ones -- the live job
driven through the UI is in there beside the 206 archived replicates.

Five suites were writing into it under job ids "T", "JOB", "FTPROBE" and
"COSTPROBE", so eight fabricated runs were sitting in the dataset. They were
found by listing the directory while looking for something else, which is not a
way to find them again.

Any suite that builds a LoopContext and calls a traced tool must redirect
CLIENT_TMP_DIR to a tempdir before the traced call. `_archive_trace` re-reads
the attribute on every call, so module scope or inside the test both work.
