"""A cache-busted asset must get a new ?v= whenever its contents change.

Why this exists
---------------
Five assets in index.html are cache-busted by hand:

    <script src="app/view/common/Util.js?v=0.8"></script>

and the server deliberately gives them a long max-age -- `revalidateEntryDocument`
says so in as many words: "Versioned assets keep their long max-age -- that is
what versioning them is for." The whole scheme rests on one manual step: bump the
number when the file changes. Nothing enforced it, and it was missed.

`1fcc5b7b` added `getClusterColor` to Util.js and left the marker at v=0.7. Every
browser that had ever loaded the site kept its cached v=0.7, which has no such
function, while getting the new PA_Step4Views.js that calls it. Step 4's pathway
details panel then threw

    ReferenceError: getClusterColor is not defined
        at PA_Step4FindFeaturesView.getClusterColor (PA_Step4Views.js:3048)
        at PA_Step3PathwayDetailsView.generatePlot (PA_Step3Views.js:3328)

so opening any pathway lost its plot. Measured in the browser, same URL, one
request with the HTTP cache and one with `cache: no-store`:

    cached: 292088 bytes, contains getClusterColor: False
    fresh:  294066 bytes, contains getClusterColor: True

A hard reload hides it, which is exactly why it survives development and only
reaches people who have used the site before -- that is, everyone except the
developer testing it in a fresh profile.

This is the second time. `revalidateEntryDocument` was written for the identical
failure with `truncatableTextRenderer`, also added to Util.js, also invisible
after a hard reload. That fix made index.html itself revalidate, which was
necessary but not sufficient: the freshly-fetched index.html still asked for
?v=0.7, so the stale Util.js stayed pinned. The remaining hole is the manual bump,
and this test closes it.

How it works: the digest of each versioned file is recorded below against the
version it was published under. Change the file and the digest stops matching,
so the test fails and tells you to bump the marker and update the entry. That is
the point -- the failure is the reminder. Updating this table without bumping
index.html defeats it, so the message says so.

Everything here is read from HEAD via `git show`, not from the working tree,
and that is a correction to how this started. Comparing the working tree meant
the test went red the moment anyone opened one of these files and stayed red
until they were finished -- which, on the client, is most of a working day. It
fired that way twice in one afternoon on edits that were still in progress. A
guard that is red while you type is one that gets ignored or deleted, and it
was never the right question anyway: the failure being prevented is a *shipped*
file whose marker did not move, and what ships is what is committed. Uncommitted
work is nobody's problem yet.

When git is unavailable or a file is not tracked, the check skips rather than
inventing a verdict.
