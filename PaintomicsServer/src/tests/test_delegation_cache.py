"""A delegation already run must not be run again.

delegate_interpretation is the agent's most expensive tool by an order of
magnitude -- a median 29.8 s per call against 0-4 ms for the data tools. Across
the 60 archived runs, 7 re-issued an identical delegation, costing 25-62 s each
(mean 40) out of a 600 s budget, for an answer the run was already holding.
Repeated delegations are 269 of the 271 seconds this agent spends re-answering
itself; every other tool is cheap enough that a repeat does not matter.

The cache is keyed on the RESOLVED pathway set rather than the argument
spelling, so the same pathways requested under a different name still hit, while
a different focus is a different question and runs.
