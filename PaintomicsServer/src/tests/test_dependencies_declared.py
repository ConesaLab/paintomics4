Run from `PaintomicsServer/`:

Three separate dependencies were found missing while preparing the release, one
of them only when the container refused to boot:

  * `requests`    -- imported by DBManager.py and downloadReactome.py
  * `chardet`     -- imported by PathwayAcquisitionJob.py; ModuleNotFoundError

  * `eval_type_backport` -- needed for `import agents` on Python 3.9

All three were invisible locally because the development environment had them
installed for unrelated reasons. This walks the AST of every module under src/

instead of in production.

    `-r ../../requirements.txt` include. That stub was well intentioned -- it
    redirected anyone installing from the path they were used to -- and it cost
    33 open Dependabot alerts.

    GitHub's dependency graph never re-parsed it. A pip manifest whose only
    content is an `-r` include yields no requirements, and rather than clearing
    the manifest GitHub kept the last snapshot it had successfully read: the
    2020 pins, Flask 1.1.2 / Werkzeug 1.0.1 / Jinja2 2.11.2 / CairoSVG 2.7.0 /
    Pillow 10.3.0. Measured against the API, every open alert on this repository
    named this file and none named the root, whose 63 alerts are all fixed --

    as 2026-08-07 (alert 320, pillow < 12.3.0). The advisories were real; the
    versions they were raised against had not been installed by anything for
    months.

    Nothing read the stub: the image installs the root file

    docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-05-drago-cloud-deployment.md, "Delete:
