"""The retry shim must not outlive the run it is retrying for.

Round 33's agent-v33-r2 finished at 1722 s against a 600 s ceiling. Its trace
explains why: 28 searches in the first two minutes, the last tool call ending
at t=118 s, and then 1604 seconds of complete silence -- no tool calls at all.
The run was inside one model call the whole time.

Every phase-level guard in the pipeline bounds the work it starts, but the
transport underneath them had a budget of its own: 4 attempts at a 180 s read
timeout (8 when throttled) with backoff, and no idea when the run was due. Its
worst case is longer than the entire run.

Two rules, both pinned here: an attempt that cannot finish before the deadline
is not started, and a cancellation is never retried.
