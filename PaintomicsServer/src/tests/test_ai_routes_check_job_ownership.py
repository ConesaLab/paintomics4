"""A job id is not authorisation to read the AI interpretation of that job.

Why this exists
---------------
`test_ai_consent_enforced` covers a different question: whether the job's
owner agreed to anything being sent OUT to the external service. It says
nothing about who may ask. Both were needed, and only the first was there.

Every `/ai_interpret_*` route verified the session with

    UserSessionManager().isValidUser(userID, sessionToken)

which deliberately admits the anonymous "nologin" caller -- `user_id == 'None'`
with no token returns True, because the application supports jobs that belong
to nobody. So the session check passed for a caller with no cookies at all, and
nothing after it consulted the job's owner. Meanwhile the results page prints a
shareable `?jobID=...` URL, so ids travel by design.

Measured against a running server, on a job whose stored record said
userID '99999' and allowSharing False, from a caller sending no cookies:

    /pa_recover_job       -> refused, "Invalid Job ID (...) for current user."
    /ai_interpret_report  -> 10,345 characters of report and its 28 papers
    /ai_interpret_status  -> the job's progress
    /ai_interpret_chat    -> an answer about the job's genes, which is an LLM
                             call billed to this deployment, made against
                             someone else's expression values

`pathwayAcquisitionRecoverJob` already had the rule. The AI routes just never
asked it, so the same job was public through one door and private through
another.

Two halves, because either alone passes for the wrong reason:

  * the decision table, exercised against `_requireJobAccess` with a stubbed
    loader. This is the half that would catch a gate that refuses everything,
    which "the call is present" cannot;
  * the presence of the call in each of the five job-scoped handlers, read off
    the syntax tree with comments stripped, so a handler added later without a
    gate fails here rather than shipping open.

`ai_provider` and `ai_generate_exp_design` are deliberately not in the list:
neither takes a jobID -- the first reports which gateway this server uses, the
second reads column headers for a job that does not exist yet and carries its
own consent check.
