"""Run and score the AI interpretation arms against the pre-registered rule.

`docs/ai-agent-benchmark.md` describes a protocol; this is the thing that
executes it. Until now it did not live in the repository at all -- it was a
scatter of scripts in a session scratchpad, which meant the documented protocol
could not be re-run by anyone, including a later session of mine. Round 25 was
pre-registered against a runner that would have vanished with the tmpdir.

Three subcommands:

    python -m src.benchmarks.ai_arm_bench ready
        One 8-token call to the configured gateway. Exit 0 if it answers.
        Two replicates once burned ten minutes each against a gateway that was
        504-ing every request and produced two "results" that were outage
        reports. A round should not start unless the instrument works.

    python -m src.benchmarks.ai_arm_bench run <jobID> <base|agent> <outdir>
        Runs one arm in-process on a stored job, writes <label>.json (metrics)
        and <label>.report.md (the prose -- the next run on that job overwrites
        the stored record, and metrics cannot answer "is this any good").

    python -m src.benchmarks.ai_arm_bench score <outdir>
        Groups the runs by arm, prints the table, and applies the five rules.

THE COVERAGE METRIC IS PROSE-ONLY, and that is not a detail. The first version
counted a pathway as covered if its name appeared anywhere in the report -- and
both arms APPEND a table of pathway names (the workflow arm's "Enriched Pathway
Summary", the agent arm's "Pathway Clusters"). The agent arm scored 102/102 by
printing a table it had not analysed. Everything from the first table marker or
the References heading onward is excluded here, permanently.

#
# The list itself became the hole it was meant to close. Audited at round 49 it
# held 40 entries, 16 of them for stats no arm still writes, and it was silencing
# 24 of the 82 stats agent_loop produces -- including the ENTIRE evidence-supply
# picture (fulltext_candidates / _upgraded / _skipped, quotes_supplied,
# quotes_reused, quotes_from_delegation, refs_rendered) and every failure signal
# in the gate (framing_failed, correction_failed, correction_skipped,
# verify_cut_short, verify_unchecked). Three consecutive rounds of work converged
# on "how much evidence did each writer actually have", and the numbers that
# answer it were being dropped on purpose, while `unarchived_stats` reported a
# clean archive. The merge stats had already been found in here for the same
# reason a round earlier.
#
# 76 of 82 are archived now. What remains is redundant rather than uninteresting,
# and each entry has to earn its place:
#
#   loop_final       the final report text; the .report.md file is the artifact
#   verification     the whole verification dict; its counts are archived flat
#   papers_retrieved already a top-level row key, written from a better source
#   tool_calls       duplicate of agent_tool_calls
#   total_s          duplicate of wall_s
#   topup_added_refs a list consumed inside the run by the gate-side pull-back
#
# This exists because round 36 was launched to measure sentence repair and could
# not: agent.py had written sentences_repaired / repairs_rejected /
# repair_unlocatable since the first commit, the bench captured none of them,
# and the archived row was silent. The stage ran; the measurement did not. The
# log could not stand in either -- it is configured at WARNING and the repair
# line is INFO.
# Twenty-one entries were pruned when the six-phase workflow arm was removed:
# they were stats only that arm wrote (partial-report salvage, cluster batch
# counts, draft scoring, gap-fill). The ratchet flags a stale entry as loudly
# as a missing one, on purpose -- a list of keys nobody writes protects

# is COMPLIANCE with the design, not a defect, and I reported it as a defect
# before reading the prompt that produces it.
#
# It is still worth measuring, because it prices a real trade-off nothing else
# can see. Separating the sentences makes every citation verifiable and leaves
# the reader to connect the data to the literature themselves; joining them --
# "Ccr2 falls 7.7-fold, consistent with the loss of chemokine responsiveness in

    95% of citation-bearing sentences are statements ABOUT A PAPER placed beside
    the data rather than claims about the data supported by a paper:

        "Integrin beta3 acts as a threshold regulator of B cell activation [1],

    meant to catch.

    Deliberately crude: it asks whether the sentence mentions the experiment at
    all, not whether the inference is sound. A model could satisfy it by

    the whole session: "converted themes 9.8 -> 13" was checked at n=4 against a
    spread that needs far more; "citations +4.6, resolved" at n=8 became +2.0 and
    unresolved at n=19; "chunk=3 cost 3.4 pathways, resolved" became +2.0 and
    unresolved once a third round landed.

    The variances are not a mystery -- they are in the archive, and base alone,
    which is FIXED code, ranges 10-15 on coverage and 10-26 on citations. So a
    round can be told in advance what it is capable of resolving, which is the
    difference between a pre-registration and a wish.

    Written because I have hand-rolled this analysis six times in a session and
    the errors kept entering there, not in the pipeline: a join on file mtime
    that matched a run 28 hours old, a `sorted(keys)[:40]` slice that hid the
    stat I was looking for, and twice a mean taken across configurations that no
    longer applied. Each produced a confident wrong answer.

    It also exists because single rounds do not resolve these metrics. Two claims
    made from n=4 and n=8 this session -- "citations +4.6, resolved" and
    "DELEGATE_CHUNK=3 cost 3.4 pathways, resolved" -- both shrank and lost
    resolution when more replicates arrived. Pooling by CONFIGURATION rather than
    by round is the operation that answers the question, so it should be a
    command rather than a heredoc.
