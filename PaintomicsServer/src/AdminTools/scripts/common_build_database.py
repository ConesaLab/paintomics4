    """
    Derive the "linked biological processes" relation for Reactome from its
    pathway hierarchy.

    Why this exists
    ---------------
    A KEGG pathway map draws boxes that point at other KEGG maps, and those
    cross-references are what the network's default edge type ("Linked
    biological processes") is built from - 1,903 edges over 584 mmu nodes.
    Reactome was given the same treatment: an edge wherever one pathway's
    diagram embeds another pathway as a process node. That is the right
    analogue, but it collects almost nothing here, because of what the
    downloader chooses to install.

    downloadReactome walks `ReactomePathwayLow - ReactomePathwayHigh`, i.e. the
    *leaves* of the hierarchy (climbing to a parent only when a leaf has no
    diagram of its own). A leaf has no sub-pathways, so it embeds no process
    nodes, so it contributes no edges. Measured on mmu: 451 edges for 524
    pathway nodes, of which 52 pointed at pathways that were never installed,
    leaving 399 real ones covering 276 nodes. Half the network was isolated
    dots, and a typical job - which draws only its significant pathways -
    showed 11 nodes and 1 edge.

    What relates two Reactome leaves is not a diagram cross-reference; it is
    where they sit in the hierarchy. Reactome states that relation explicitly
    in ReactomePathwaysRelation - the same file the downloader already reads to
    decide what to fetch.

    The rule
    --------
    Two installed pathways are linked when they share an ancestor and the sum
    of their two distances up to it is at most `maxCombinedDepth`; an installed
    ancestor is linked to an installed descendant on the same budget. At the
    default of 3 that means siblings (1+1), and "one of the pair nested one
    level deeper than the other" (1+2).

    That extra level is not slack, it is the case the control exists for. Four
    of the eleven significant Reactome pathways in the job this was diagnosed
    on are extracellular-matrix processes, but only two of them are siblings:
    "Laminin interactions" hangs directly off "Extracellular matrix
    organization" while "Collagen chain trimerization" sits one step further
    down, under "Collagen formation". A siblings-only rule calls those
    unrelated. KEGG would have drawn all four inside a single map.

    Measured on mmu, per budget - pairs, nodes covered of 524, and the degree
    distribution, against KEGG's 1,903 pairs over 584 nodes at max 167 /
    median 6 / mean 8.7:

        <=2 (siblings only)  1,375   489/524   max  20, median  4, mean  5.6
        <=3 (default)        3,259   517/524   max  56, median 10, mean 12.6
        <=4                  6,786   523/524   max  89, median 22, mean 26.0

    3 is where the ECM case is recovered and the graph is still legible; 4
    connects almost everything to almost everything, which says nothing. (The
    <=4 row is the uncapped count - mmu's largest group is 57 within two levels
    but 90 within three, so `maxGroupSize` fires at that budget and brings it
    to 4,259. It does not fire at the default.)

    Groups are emitted as cliques rather than stars because the shared ancestor
    is usually not itself an installed node, so there is nothing to centre a
    star on. `maxGroupSize` bounds the quadratic: an ancestor with more
    installed descendants than that falls back to true siblings only, and says
    so on stderr rather than silently thinning the graph. mmu's largest group
    is 57, so it does not fire there - it exists because the group size is a
    property of the species' Reactome coverage, not of this code.

    :param installedPathways: set of pathway stIds that exist as network nodes.
        Pairs are only emitted between two members of this set, which is also
        what keeps the 52 dangling edges out.
    :param relationFile: path to ReactomePathwaysRelation.list (parent<TAB>child).
    :param speciesMarker: e.g. "R-MMU-". Matched as a prefix on both columns:
        the file holds every species at once, and a bare substring test picks up
        foreign identifiers.
    :returns: set of (a, b) tuples, a < b, so the caller can de-duplicate
        against edges it has already emitted in either direction.

    MapMan inputs used to be hand-copied from a private directory on one
    machine (`/home/tian/mapman/`), which made the MapMan organisms
    unrebuildable anywhere else. They are all published by GoMapMan, whose
    export API serves them over plain HTTPS, so `resource` describes a URL
    rather than a local path.

    Unlike `downloadFile` this helper is strict on purpose: the installer
    pipes whatever it downloads straight into MongoDB, so a 404 body that is
    silently stored as the mapping file becomes a plausible-looking database
    full of HTML. Every download is therefore verified before it is accepted.

    Recognised `resource` keys, beyond the usual url/file/output:
      decompress   -- gunzip the payload after download (GoMapMan ships .gz)
      skip_header  -- drop the first line (the metabolite export has one)
      expect       -- "tsv" or "targz"; shape check applied after decompression
      local        -- absolute path to a file shipped in the source tree; used
                      instead of url/file, with no network access

    `local` exists because GoMapMan publishes gene-to-entrez for ath, sly and
    stu only. Rice's KEGG cross-link is derived rather than published, so it
    ships in osa_resources/ and is copied in here. The caller resolves it to
    an absolute path (ROOT_DIR is known there, not here). Everything after
    the fetch -- decompress, skip_header, validate, and removing a rejected
    payload -- is deliberately shared with the download path so a local
    resource cannot bypass the shape checks.
