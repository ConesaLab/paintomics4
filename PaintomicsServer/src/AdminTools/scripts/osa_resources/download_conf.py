# Rice (Oryza sativa japonica), MapMan 3.6-era, from GoMapMan.
#
# Browse the tree with: https://gomapman.nib.si/api/GetFolderInfo/
# %7C is the '|' path separator the export API uses.
#
# Two things about rice differ from ath/sly/sot and are the reason this file
# exists rather than being a copy of one of theirs:
#
# 1. GoMapMan publishes gene-to-entrez for ath, sly and stu ONLY. There is no
#    gene-to-entrez_osa.tsv.gz -- the export API answers an unknown path with
#    HTTP 200 and a 9,682-byte Angular shell, so a plain download would store
#    that HTML as the cross-link and the species would install with MapMan
#    bins that link to nothing. The KEGG cross-link is therefore shipped in
#    this directory and declared with "local" instead of a url/file pair.
#    build_gene_to_entrez_osa.py in this directory documents the derivation
#    and regenerates the file byte-for-byte from its primary sources.
#
# 2. Rice has two KEGG organism codes and only one of them can host this data.
#    KEGG `osa` is keyed on NCBI GeneIDs; KEGG `dosa` is keyed on RAP-DB ids
#    and answers HTTP 400 for /conv/dosa/ncbi-geneid (see the comment in
#    DBManager.getSpecieMappingData). processMapManMappingData joins the
#    cross-link's second column through ncbi-geneid2kegg.list, so it can only
#    work under `osa`. Do not move this to dosa_resources.
#
# GoMapMan is CC BY-NC-SA and its species codes are NOT KEGG codes -- `osa`
# happens to mean Oryza sativa on both sides, which is why rice is installable
# while GoMapMan's bvu/tae/tca/cam are not (they name entirely different
# organisms in KEGG).
