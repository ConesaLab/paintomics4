"""The real STATegra data, registered rather than generated.

This is the mouse Ikaros time course PaintOmics has always shipped: six time
points of real published measurements. Nothing here rewrites a byte of it. The
files move into the same `datasets/` layout as the simulated scenarios and gain
manifest entries, so the loader has one way to find every example instead of one
way plus three hardcoded special cases.

There are three entries, not one, because the old code had three separate
hardcoded examples over this same dataset -- one per entry point:

    PathwayAcquisitionServlet  six omics, already mapped to genes
    Bed2GenesServlet           the DNase regions, before mapping
    MiRNA2GenesServlet         the miRNA table, before mapping

`stategra-multiomics` stays the **default**: clicking "Load example" without
choosing gives the real data, which is the behaviour that exists today.

Why no expected counts
----------------------
The same job yields 888/44 matched pathways on the deploy VM and 877/41 locally
because the two carry different KEGG snapshots. These entries record what the
files *are*, never what analysing them produces.
