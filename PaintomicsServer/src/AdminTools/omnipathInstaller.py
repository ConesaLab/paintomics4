"""Install OmniPath as a pathway database source for one organism.

Why this installer looks different from the KEGG/Reactome/MapMan ones
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Every other source Paintomics paints ships a *diagram*: an image plus a
coordinate for each feature drawn on it. OmniPath ships none. It is a
prior-knowledge network -- signed, directed molecular interactions -- with no
canvas and no node positions anywhere in the resource.

So an OmniPath pathway is stored here with its genes carrying **no
coordinates**, exactly the shape KEGG already produces for the ~29% of its
genes that belong to a pathway without being drawn on its map. The pathway
renders as an interactive network in the client instead of as a painted raster,
which is also the only honest rendering: a force-directed layout is an artifact
of the solver, not a statement about biology, so it is presented as a graph the
user can move rather than as a map whose geometry means something.

What a "pathway" is here
------------------------
OmniPath keeps pathway *membership* and the interaction *network* in two
separate datasets. This installer combines them:

  * membership comes from the ``annotations`` endpoint, restricted to the
    curated causal resources named in ``PARTITIONS``;
  * edges come from the ``interactions`` endpoint for the target organism;
  * a pathway is the subnetwork the members induce on that graph.

Organisms
---------
The web service serves exactly three taxa -- human, mouse and rat -- and
rejects every other with ``Unknown values for argument organisms``. Its
``annotations`` endpoint takes no organism parameter at all: membership is
human. Mouse and rat therefore need the human members carried across, and this
installer does **not** guess that mapping from gene-symbol casing. It recovers
the real one from OmniPath itself: the mouse and rat interaction tables are
orthology translations of the human table, so a translated row keeps its
source literature, and aligning the two tables on that provenance recovers the
ortholog pairs OmniPath actually used. See ``derive_ortholog_map``.
