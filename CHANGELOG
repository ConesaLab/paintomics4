        - Network sometimes is not being drawn (he forzado que se dibuje)
        - Fix Contingency table 
        - Add region quantification and miRNA to genes options in file type selector
        - Upload files -> if I choose first a file from my PC and then change to My Data, the local file is sent to server
        - Upload files --> added a new option "Clear selection"
        - After filtering pathways by classification, update the displayed number of pathways and significant pathways 
        - After feature name mapping, changed the method for creating the ZIP file with results (sometimes it failed)
        - Filter miRNAs: by cutoff (score) and by DE/all option
        - My data panel --> fixed problems (update content after uploding files)
        - Change password in My Data panel
        [Admin site]
        - Reference files: allow admin to register new file without uploading the file (e.g. upload using terminal), in case of huge files
        - Improved tools for installing, updating and deleteing species
        - Added settings to specify the valid ADMIN_ACCOUNTS and added functions to test valid admin account
        - CRON job  for cleaning databases
        - Clean databases option in admin site
        - USER ACCOUNTS en config
        - Remove ROOT_DIR & examples dir (now auto-calculated)

	- Improved the metabolite selection panel: more information and added some control for repeated metabolites
	- Now it is possible to find all the occurrences of a feature in the diagram using the "Search" tool
	- New tool for miRNA data: using "miRNA2Genes" users can convert their miRNA data into a valid input format for PaintOmics 3.
	- Added a "close" button for tooltip in the pathway diagram
	- Some improvements in visual styles
	- Improved the Metabolomics significance analysis, now it is more accurate
	- Fixed problems with the height of some pathways diagram
	- Fixed many bugs

Changelog (v0.4.2) - 2016-08-01

	- Fixed many bugs

Changelog (v0.4.1) - 2016-03-10

	- Fixed problems when logging in the application (thanks Paul Vu).
	- New ranking table visualization: now the table is colored by significance (p-value), a nice tool to identify the enriched functions.
	- Improved administration tools. Fixed issues when installing new species.
	- Added this nice messaging system.
	- Fixed some issues with panel layouts during pathway visualization
	- Added new information about trends at pathway visualization
