# I get an error every time I upload my data, what am I doing wrong?

Be sure to check the message of the error, if any, as it may contain useful information like maximum number of lines exceeded, invalid numerical format... Also do not forget to read the appropiate documentation section (<a href="http://paintomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2_1_accepted_input/" target="_blank">accepted input data</a>) and download the example files to check them.

# The page has been stuck for a very long time, waiting at the job to complete. Is it working?

If the page has been loading for more than 10 minutes then probably an error ocurred but the application failed to show it, if the job was completed a reload might help, otherwise you might need to resubmit the data again.

# Things were working smoothly but now I see weird artifacts or random freezes when visualizing data.

This should not happen, but the application stores data in the local cache of the browser to speed up things and sometimes (for example due to new pushed changes) unexpected errors can arise. If you click "Reset view" the session data will be cleared and entering to the job again will retrieve it from the server.

# The background pathway images do not match the boxes positions. What is going on?

Probably the species you are using has not been updated in a while, please contact with us so we can solve it.

# I ran my job a while ago and now after redoing it with the same data my enrichment results are different. Why?

Many things could have happened but probably the species data was updated between the two jobs, hence affecting both the matching and enrichment results.
