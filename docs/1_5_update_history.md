# Release notes

The authoritative, complete list of changes is
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ConesaLab/PaintOmics/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
in the repository. This page summarises what a user of PaintOmics 4 will notice
that is different.

## Unreleased — PaintOmics AI

The successor to PaintOmics 4 has not been cut as a numbered release yet.
Everything below is on `master`. Which of it is switched on depends on the
server you are using — see [What the AI does](ai-overview.md#what-is-on-by-default).

### New analyses

* **AI pathway interpretation.** An agent reads your ranked pathways and your
  own measurements, searches PubMed and Europe PMC, and drafts an
  interpretation with numbered citations. Every quotation is checked against
  the paper it came from, and a claim whose citation cannot be verified is
  removed rather than published. See [The pathway
  interpretation](ai-interpretation.md).
* **Metabolite class activity.** Whether a whole KEGG BRITE class responded,
  at three levels of the hierarchy — a permutation test on your own replicates
  when the upload has them, a binomial test on your relevant list when it does
  not. See [Metabolite class
  activity](4_5_metabolite_class_activity_analysis.md).
* **Metabolite hub analysis.** Which metabolites have differentially expressed
  genes concentrated around them in the KEGG reaction network. See [Metabolite
  hub analysis](4_4_metabolite_hub_analysis.md).
* **Regulatory modelling with MORE**, behind a method chooser with four
  engines — PLS1 and MLR, each on the R reference implementation or on a Rust
  port — plus a regulator–target network on the results screen and
  regulation-per-condition tables that hand off into the pathway view. See
  [Regulatory omics](4_6_Regulatory_omics.md).
* **OmniPath** as a fourth pathway database. See [The OmniPath interaction
  network](1_6_omnipath.md).

### New in the workflow

* **Any number of conditions.** Analyses run across as many conditions as your
  files carry, not two, with per-condition significance stars in the heatmaps,
  in the hub analysis and in class activity, and a weights panel for the
  combined p-value.
* **Replicates.** Per-sample values with an experimental design, aggregated for
  the visualisation and used directly by MORE and by the class activity test.
* **An input-format check on every file you pick**, with one-click
  deterministic repairs for mechanical faults, and — on servers that have
  turned it on — an [AI converter](ai-input-converter.md) for files that are
  not in PaintOmics' format at all.
* **Compound disambiguation** on Step 2, with an AI suggestion for the
  ambiguous names in one pass (capped at 90 sets per run, so a job with
  hundreds of them takes more than one).
* **Example datasets** for every pipeline, generated from a manifest that also
  records the pathways the analysis should recover. See [The example
  datasets](examples.md).
* **Jobs are kept for as long as the interface says they will be** — 7 days for
  a guest job, 14 for one belonging to an account — and no longer.

### New in the interface

* The application is renamed **PaintOmics AI**. Navigation moved into the
  header and the left rail was removed.
* A dark theme, with a toggle in the header.
* A contents sidebar on the results screen that follows the database tab you
  are looking at.
* An organism picker that ranks matches by what you typed.
* A rebuilt heatmap colour scale, fitted to the range your data actually
  occupies, and the same ramp now paints the pathway diagrams.
* A progress bar for a running job that only moves forward and says what the
  job is doing.
* **Browse…** moved inside the file field, and every file row now says whether
  the job requires that file.

### Under the hood

Python 3.11, Flask 3 and pymongo 4 against MongoDB 7; a Docker Compose
deployment with nginx and TLS; and continuous integration with a pull-request
gate and a nightly regression run against recorded baselines.
