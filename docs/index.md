**Integrative visualization of multiple *omic* data**

**Welcome to PaintOmics v3.0 documentation.**

**PaintOmics** is a web tool for the integrative visualization of multiple omic datasets onto KEGG pathways. Currently Paintomics supports integrated visualization of multiple species of different biological kingdoms and offers user the possibility to request any other organism present in the KEGG database.

PaintOmics  is easy to run because the application itself guides you through the three different steps that are detailed next:

* **Data uploading:**
    1. Choose your organism (see selection box below).
    2. Upload your multi-omic data (see menu below). You can download the example data from here to check the format of the files. You can also load an example (“Load example” button in the upper right corner of the screen) to explore Paintomics functionalities.
    3. Click on "RUN PAINTOMICS" button.
* **Identifier and Name Matching and Metabolite assignment:** Paintomics requires Entrez IDs for working with KEGG pathways, so the tool will convert the names and identifiers from different sources and databases in user’s the input data. This screen give users information about the number of features successfully mapped to KEGG pathways. It also shows the data distribution that will be used for pathway colouring, which can be modified when visualizing a pathway. Additionally, the metabolite names assignments are displayed and users can choose their favourite option in case of ambiguity. Click NEXT STEP button when you are ready.
* **Results:** Pathways summary, Pathways classification, Pathways network, Pathways enrichment, Pathways visualization (by clicking PAINT BUTTON for any of the displayed pathways in Pathways enrichment section). Read more about these analyses in our documentation.
