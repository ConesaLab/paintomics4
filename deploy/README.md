# Deploying PaintOmics 4

The stack is three containers: **nginx** (TLS, reverse proxy) → **app**
(Flask + uWSGI + the in-process job queue) → **mongo** (MongoDB 7, not
published).

## Requirements

- Docker Engine 24+ with the Compose plugin
- Outbound HTTPS to `rest.kegg.jp`, `reactome.org`, `ftp.ebi.ac.uk`,
  `packagemanager.posit.co`, PyPI and the LLM gateway
- Inbound TCP 80 and 443
- Disk sized for the species you install (see [Pathway data](#pathway-data))

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConesaLab/paintomics4.git
cd paintomics4

cp deploy/env.example deploy/.env
$EDITOR deploy/.env               # see "Configuration" below

./deploy/make-cert.sh <your-hostname-or-ip>

docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml up -d --build
```

The first build takes 15–30 minutes; most of it is R packages.

## Configuration

Everything lives in `deploy/.env`. Nothing is baked into the image, and
`PaintomicsServer/src/conf/serverconf.py` is generated at container start from
`src/resources/example_serverconf.py`.

| Variable | Consequence if unset |
|---|---|
| `PAINTOMICS_BASE_URL` | **Container refuses to start.** It is embedded in activation emails, so a wrong value silently breaks registration. |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | App starts; registration and password-reset email cannot be sent, so **new users cannot activate accounts**. Logged as a warning at start-up. |
| `AI_CSIC_API_KEY` | App starts; AI interpretation requests fail. Set `AI_INTERPRETATION_ENABLED=false` to disable the feature cleanly. |
| `AI_PUBMED_API_KEY` | Works, but NCBI rate-limits to 3 req/s instead of 10. |

## Two constraints that must not be relaxed

**`processes = 1` in `uwsgi.ini`.** `src/common/PySiQ.py` is an in-process,
thread-backed job queue holding all job state in the memory of the process that
accepted the request. With two workers, a job submitted to worker A is invisible
to worker B: submission succeeds, the status endpoint is served by a process
that has never heard of the job, and it appears to hang forever. Scaling out
requires replacing PySiQ with a shared broker first. Concurrency comes from
`threads`.

**MongoDB is never published.** It runs without authentication and is reachable
only on the Compose network. Adding a `ports:` mapping would expose an
unauthenticated database to the internet.

## Pathway data

A fresh deployment has an empty database. Install species explicitly.

```bash
# Download, then build. Human, with Reactome:
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml exec -T app \
  python /app/PaintomicsServer/src/AdminTools/DBManager.py \
  download --specie=hsa --kegg=1 --mapping=1 --common=1 --reactome=1

docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml exec -T app \
  python /app/PaintomicsServer/src/AdminTools/DBManager.py \
  install --specie=hsa
```

Repeat with `--specie=mmu` for mouse. Use `--common=0` on every species after
the first: the common step re-downloads the shared KEGG reference data and takes
far longer than the species-specific part.

Rough sizes: shared common data ~1.4 GB, Reactome shared ~856 MB, and roughly
200–400 MB per species. All 94 KEGG species with Reactome comes to ~219 GB.

**Not every KEGG organism exists in Reactome.** Reactome curates human and infers
about 20 other species. Installing one it does not cover fails with a clear
message naming the species; use `--reactome=0` for those.

## Reference GTF for the Regions2Genes example

`Supporting tools -> From Regions to Genes -> Load example` reads
`examplefiles/GTF/sorted_mmu.gtf`, which the repository does not ship — only a
`GTF/.dummy` placeholder. Without it the tool fails immediately with
"Reference file not found.":

```bash
deploy/fetch-example-gtf.sh            # defaults to container paintomics-app-1
```

It downloads Ensembl GRCm38 (mm10 — the assembly the example BED was called
against), trims it to the feature types RGMatch reads, and installs it. Takes a
few minutes and lands ~566 MB.

**Re-run this after every image rebuild.** `examplefiles/` is baked into the
image rather than mounted from the `paintomics-data` volume, so a rebuilt image
loses the GTF. The script is idempotent: it exits immediately if the file is
already in place.

## Everyday operations

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml ps
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml logs -f app
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml restart app
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml down          # keeps volumes
```

Deploying a new version:

```bash
git pull
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml up -d --build
```

Volumes survive; pathway data is not re-downloaded.

## Backups

Two volumes hold irreplaceable state: `paintomics-data` (user jobs and uploads)
and `mongo-data`.

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml exec -T mongo \
  mongodump --archive --gzip --db=PaintomicsDB > mongo-$(date +%F).archive.gz
```

Pathway data is reproducible from KEGG and Reactome, so it need not be backed up
— but re-downloading it takes hours.

On the Drago VM, take a Cinder snapshot before any upgrade. The volume quota has
400 GiB free specifically so snapshots are possible.

## Switching to a trusted certificate

`make-cert.sh` produces a self-signed certificate, so browsers warn. HSTS is
deliberately commented out in `nginx/paintomics.conf` while that is true —
committing browsers to HTTPS-only for a host whose certificate they distrust
makes the site unreachable, and the policy is cached.

Once a DNS name exists, replace `nginx/certs/paintomics.{crt,key}`, uncomment
the HSTS header, and `docker compose restart nginx`.

## Troubleshooting

**A job never finishes.** Check `processes` in `uwsgi.ini` is still 1.

**Reactome install fails on a species.** Expected for species Reactome does not
cover. The error names the species; reinstall with `--reactome=0`.

**Reactome downloads repeatedly fail for the same pathway.** Previously, an HTTP
error body could be cached as a `.json` file and reused forever. That is fixed —
invalid cached downloads are now detected and re-fetched — but a download
directory poisoned by an older version self-heals only on the next run.

**Hub Analysis or Metagenes fails.** These shell out to R. Verify inside the
container:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml exec app \
  Rscript -e 'for (p in c("purrr","amap","cluster","factoextra","mclust")) \
              if (!requireNamespace(p, quietly=TRUE)) stop("missing: ", p); cat("ok\n")'
```

**Uploads rejected at ~100 MB.** `client_max_body_size` (nginx),
`SERVER_MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` (app) and `limit-post` (uWSGI) must all agree.

## Tests

```bash
cd PaintomicsServer
python -m src.tests.test_release_hygiene     # no secret is committed
python -m src.tests.test_pymongo4_compat     # no removed pymongo API is used
python -m src.tests.test_reactome_install    # Reactome installer invariants
python -m src.tests.test_bug_fixes           # multi-condition statistics
```

`test_release_hygiene` should be run before every tag: it is what stops a
credential reaching a public repository again.
