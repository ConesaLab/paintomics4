# Install the mouse reference GTF that the "From Regions to Genes" example needs.
#
# Bed2GenesServlet.py hardcodes examplefiles/GTF/sorted_mmu.gtf for its example
# run, but that file has never been in the repository -- only a GTF/.dummy
# placeholder. Without it the tool fails immediately with "Reference file not
# found.", so this script is part of bringing a deployment up, not an optional
# extra.
#
# Assembly: GRCm38 (mm10), not GRCm39. The example BED carries mm10 coordinates.
# Checked by mapping the shipped regions onto both assemblies and comparing the
# result against the shipped already-mapped gene table
# (examplefiles/dnase_values.tab): GRCm38 recovers 66.2% of those genes,
# GRCm39 only 37.8%. Do not "upgrade" this to GRCm39 -- the example data would
# have to be re-called first.
#
# The GTF is trimmed to the three feature types RGMatch reads (exon, transcript,
# gene) on the primary chromosomes. DHS_exon_association.py ignores CDS, UTR and
# codon rows entirely, so dropping them is lossless here and takes the file from
# 1.03 GB to 566 MB.
#
# Usage:
#   deploy/fetch-example-gtf.sh [container-name]
#
# Re-run this after any image rebuild: examplefiles/ is baked into the image
# (only /data is a volume), so a rebuilt image loses the GTF again.
