/* The landing hero's explainer diagram: your omic data -> mapped onto
   pathways -> ranked and painted, with the AI strip beneath.

   This replaces the graphical abstract in the hero slot. That asset is a
   1622x996 raster of a scientific figure with embedded screenshots and
   labels, and the hero renders it at 340px -- a 4.8x downscale at which
   none of its text can be read. It is still the right asset for print and
   for the docs, so the link below the diagram opens it full size.

   Ported from the design system's marketing/PaintomicsFlow, with two
   deliberate departures. The ramp is the product's own rather than the
   system's ColorBrewer values: the component's stated constraint is that
   these colours match the painted pathway diagrams, and what the product
   actually paints is getColor(..., 'bwr') in PA_Step3Views.js -- a pure RGB
   ramp, red at max, white at zero, blue at min. And the three beats are
   stacked as rows rather than set as columns, so the viewBox is 1:1 with
   the rendered width and every label is drawn at the size it is read at;
   the system's 660-wide landscape version has to shrink to 0.65 in this
   slot, which takes its 11px labels down to about 7px. */
/* The flow diagram, split into the three pieces it was always made of.
   It used to sit in the hero as one 460x356 picture whose three stacked
   panels were the same three stages the "How it works" cards describe -
   so the page drew the pipeline twice, once as a picture beside the
   title and once as text below it. Each panel now lives in the card
   that explains it, which is also what fills those cards: they were
   forced to a common 335px by the grid while their prose ran out 38,
   59 and 97px short, so the tallest one was a third empty.

   Wrapped in a translate group rather than re-numbered. Every element
   below keeps the coordinates it was authored with, and the group moves
   the origin, so nothing here can drift out of alignment with the
   artwork it came from. */
/* The hero visual: the product doing its own job.
   
   A pathway network is drawn, its features are painted with the same bwr ramp
   the application paints real data with - red high, white zero, blue low - and
   then the AI panel reads the painted result and writes an interpretation.
   That is literally the pipeline, so this is the one picture on the page that
   is not decoration: everything it shows, the tool actually does.

   Colours are the product's own. The node fills come from the bwr ramp in
   PA_Step3Views, the grey is the stroke KEGG diagrams use, and the AI blue is
   --pa-ai-blue. Nothing here invents a palette.

   Animation lives in main.css so it can be turned off under
   prefers-reduced-motion, where every element simply renders in its final
   state - a painted network beside a written interpretation. */
/* The hero visual: the product doing its own job.

   Two pathway networks, cross-faded. Each carries its own topology and its own
   values, painted with the same bwr ramp the application paints real data with
   - red high, white zero, blue low. Recolouring a single fixed network was not
   enough: the point is that you ask about a different pathway and get a
   different answer, so the network has to change too.

   Between the network and the panel sits the agent that actually does the
   work: earlier versions drew the network beside the interpretation with
   nothing between them, which read as the panel simply knowing the answer.
   It doesn't - it queries the painted values, searches the literature, and
   only then writes, and the citation pills at the bottom of the panel are
   where that search shows up. So the middle of the pipeline gets a node of
   its own: a pulse leaves the network, the agent pings while it works, a
   second pulse carries the result on to the panel, and only then does the
   panel start writing. One full pass per network, twice a cycle.

   Colours and shapes are the product's own. Circles are compounds and boxes
   are genes, exactly as the KEGG diagrams in the step cards below draw them,
   the grey is their stroke, and the agent and the citations share the AI blue
   - --pa-ai-blue. Nothing here invents a palette.

   The whole cycle is 9s and never stops. Animation lives in main.css so it can
   be turned off under prefers-reduced-motion, where the first network, an idle
   agent and a finished interpretation simply render as a still. */

 *
 * The picker offers three: PLS1 on the Rust engine, PLS1 on R, and MLR on R.
 * Which of them a given host can actually run is not a fact the client can
 * know -- the deployed image carries /usr/bin/Rscript and none of MORE,
 * optparse, ropls or glmnet, so a list hardcoded here would offer two options
 * that pass every check in the browser and then fail deep inside the job.
 *
 * /more_backends answers it, from a probe of the R *packages* rather than the
 * interpreter. One request, cached for the page.
 *
 * The fallback matters as much as the success path: if the request fails, the
 * picker is filled with the same three entries marked available, because a
 * server that cannot answer is more likely to be an old one that has no such
 * route than one with nothing installed -- and refusing every engine on a
 * transport error would take a working feature down. The server refuses an
 * engine it cannot run anyway (MOREServlet.engineRefusal), so the cost of
 * being optimistic here is a clear message at submission rather than a
 * mislabelled dropdown.
