/**
* Normalises the "mapped" slot of an omic summary (omicSummary[0]) into a
* matched-feature count per database.
*
* That slot arrives in two different shapes from the server:
*
*   - Gene based omics: a dict of feature-table name -> matched count, e.g.
*     {"mmu_kegg_genes": 5620, "mmu_reactome_genes": 2827, "Total": 6103}.
*     The table name embeds the database name, and "Total" holds the unique
*     count across every database.
*
*   - Compound based omics: a plain integer. Compounds are matched once
*     against KEGG compound IDs and that single set backs every database, so
*     the server has no per-database breakdown to report.
*
* Indexing the dict shape into an integer yields undefined, which is how the
* "Multiple databases used" table came to print "undefined (NaN%)" for the
* metabolomics omic.
*
* @param {Object|Number} mappedSummary the omicSummary[0] value
* @param {Array} databases names of the databases used in this analysis
* @returns {Object} {perDatabase: {dbname: count}, totalMapped: count}
