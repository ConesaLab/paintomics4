     * The omic cards are items in an ExtJS vbox, and the vbox lays them out as
     * position:absolute elements carrying an inline `top`. That is the whole
     * difficulty: growing a card's DOM does not move the card below it,
     * because nothing rewrites that `top`.
     *
     * What this module used to do about that was compute the height the card
     * ought to have and setHeight() it. A computed height is a MEASUREMENT,
     * and a measurement has a moment. The MORE card is tall enough that its
     * sections had not settled when the card was primed -- 662px recorded
     * where itemsContainer alone settles at 684 -- so the card was pinned 66px
     * short of its own contents. The omic title is itself a `flex: 1` item, so
     * the vbox took the entire shortfall out of the title: it was allocated
     * 0px, CSS min-height painted it at 44px regardless, and it landed on top
     * of the first section heading. Reported twice from a screenshot.
     *
     * There is no number to get wrong in what replaces it. A vbox child with
     * neither `flex` nor an explicit height shrink-wraps its own items, so the
     * card is whatever its contents are, whenever they change; updateLayout()
     * is what rewrites the siblings' `top`.
     *
     * Dropping `flex` is what makes that hold, and it is also the reading
     * behind the older note here that "updateLayout() on the card does not
     * work": while the card shares a height budget with its siblings, its
     * height is the layout's to decide and updateLayout() can only hand back
     * the same number. Out of the budget, it works. Measured on the MORE card:
     * idle strip -> card 771px, title 44px, overlap 0; growing the strip by
     * 34px -> card 805px and the card below moved from 1028 to 1062. Plain
     * cards go 178 -> 175, which is exactly the 3px the title's own flex had

     * count for the whole job from the first values file it reads and holds

     * each file is. That is the 2026-08-27 guest report (job q603AOxICD):
     * two green ticks on the form, "Expected 2 columns but found 15" from the
     * server, and an agent that, handed either file alone, rightly found
     * nothing to fix.
     *
     * So the widths are compared HERE, across the cards, the moment a second
     * values file is checked; the cards involved say so; Run is stopped the
     * way a known-bad file stops it; and the one action offered is the one
     * that can fix a disagreement between files -- handing them to the agent
     * together (openHarmoniseDrawer), not one at a time.
