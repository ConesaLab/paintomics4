/**
 * PA_Step3HubNetworkView -- metabolite hub analysis as a network, not a table.
 *
 * Why this exists. The KEGG interaction graph has always been on the server and
 * never reached the browser: compoundRegulateFeatures ships node SETS with no
 * pairs, no direction, no edge types and no intermediate hops, so a client could
 * not tell whether a radius-3 gene reached the metabolite via gene X or gene Y.
 * The hub table reported numbers about a network nobody could see.
 *
 * This panel replaces that table. A metabolite LIST -- one entry per compound,
 * ranked by significance -- selects the seed; the network draws its 1..4 step
 * neighbourhood as concentric rings; the step control and the expression
 * figures live INSIDE the network stage.
 *
 * Layout rule, learned the hard way: the detail sat below a 720px canvas, so
 * clicking a node put its heatmap 448px below the fold. It drew correctly and
 * nobody could see it, which from the user's seat is identical to a dead click.
 * Anything a click produces is now docked in the stage, above the fold, and the
 * canvas shrinks to make room rather than being covered.
 *
 * Encoding, decided colour-last:
 *
 *   position (ring) -> hop distance      the layout already carries it, so
 *                                        distance deliberately takes NO colour
 *   node face       -> one wedge per condition, in that omic's heatmap colours
 *   filled/hollow   -> DE vs not DE      so identity is never colour-alone
 *   dashed stroke   -> never measured    absence shown as absence
 *   shape           -> compound / gene
 *   size            -> the seed, and DE nodes (they carry the wedges)
 *
 * The face used to be a single fill, chosen by `values[0] < 0 ? down : up`.
 * A fill is one colour, so it had to answer "up or down?" for a feature that
 * has one answer PER CONDITION, and it answered with condition 1 -- which is
 * how citric acid came out red ("up") on the STATegra job while the heatmap
 * directly beneath it fell from +0.22 at 0h to -0.34 at 24h. That is not a
 * near miss: across that job's DE features the first condition disagrees with
 * the largest-magnitude one for 26% of genes and 68% of metabolites.
 *
 * No summary rule replaces it, because none of them is right. moanin, which
 * exists to reduce a time course to one fold change, says so itself: when a
 * feature is not consistently up- or down-regulated the estimated direction
 * does not represent the observed changes. So the reduction is gone rather
 * than improved. Slicing is what the field does with this -- Pathview cuts a
 * node into one piece per state, VANTED draws a chart inside it, Escher
 * refuses to aggregate at all -- and Paintomics' own pathway diagrams already
 * draw one box per condition. This is that encoding on a round node.
 *
 * The edges follow: a lit edge says its neighbour is DE, and the neighbour's
 * own face says what it did. An edge cannot carry six values, so it does not
 * claim one.
 *
 * "Measured but not DE" is most of the graph, so those nodes stay hollow and
 * the STROKE carries their contrast: the near-white diverging midpoint was
 * rejected at 1.12:1 against the light surface.
 */
/**
 * Everything in an omic figure that is not a data row: the chart's top margin
 * plus the room the rotated condition names need under the plot area.
 *
 * The panel used `rows * 30 + 100`, which is what the pathway views use in
 * containers 400px wider. Here the axis labels are drawn at -45 degrees and
 * the last line of them was clipped by the container -- on the STATegra job
 * the "I/C_24h" chips lost their bottom half. Sized from what the axis
 * actually needs: 12 characters at 9px, rotated, is about 40px of vertical
 * run, and the chart wants ~28px above the plot area and ~20px of padding
 * below the labels.

 * graph's 161 nodes were truncated the same way, and they are exactly the hub
 * nodes the panel exists to explain: the median degree is 2, so the cap only
 * ever bit the interesting cases.
 *
 * Pure on purpose -- `describe` is injected rather than read off `me`, so the
