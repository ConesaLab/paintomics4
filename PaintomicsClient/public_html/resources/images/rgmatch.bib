abstract = {Background: The integrative analysis of multiple genomics data often 
requires that genome coordinates-based signals have to be associated 
with proximal genes. The relative location of a genomic region with 
respect to the gene (gene area) is important for functional data 
interpretation; hence algorithms that match regions to genes should be 
able to deliver insight into this information. 
Results: In this work we review the tools that are publicly available 
for making region-to-gene associations. We also present a novel method, RGmatch, a flexible and easy-to-use Python tool that computes 
associations either at the gene, transcript, or exon level, applying a 
set of rules to annotate each region-gene association with the region 
location within the gene. RGmatch can be applied to any organism as long 
as genome annotation is available. Furthermore, we qualitatively and 
quantitatively compare RGmatch to other tools. 
Conclusions: RGmatch simplifies the association of a genomic region with 
its closest gene. At the same time, it is a powerful tool because the 
rules used to annotate these associations are very easy to modify 
according to the researcher's specific interests. Some important 
differences between RGmatch and other similar tools already in existence 
are RGmatch's flexibility, its wide range of user options, compatibility 
with any annotatable organism, and its comprehensive and user-friendly 
output.},
