/* One box on the upload form is ticked here rather than in the form: the AI
   interpretation consent.

   It is a *consent*, not a preference. Ticking it sends pathway summaries,
   feature lists, per-feature values and the experiment design text to whatever
   LLM endpoint the server is configured for -- by default a gateway operated
   by IIIA-CSIC, not a commercial API, but that is a server setting and not
   something this file can assert; SERVER_URL_AI_PROVIDER below is how the
   interface finds out. A pre-ticked consent box is not consent under GDPR
   Art. 4(11) / Art. 7 -- it has to be an affirmative act. On localhost the
   only person whose data is at stake is the one who ticked it, so the reason
   does not apply; anywhere else it does, and the box stays as the visitor
   found it.

   Hence the hostname test: on for 127.0.0.1 / localhost, off for every
   deployed host, with no build step or separate config file to keep in sync.
   The server side is untouched -- it still reads the submitted value and
   AIInterpretServlet still refuses any job whose stored record says no.

   DEFAULT_REACTOME_ENABLED used to live here, gated the same way, and no
   longer exists. Reactome is not a local-development preference: it is either
   installed for the chosen organism or it is not, which is a fact about the
   server and not about who is looking at it. SERVER_URL_GET_ORGANISM_DATABASES
   below answers that per organism, and step 1 ticks every database the answer
   contains on every host. */
